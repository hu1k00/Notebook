<ul>
<li><p><strong>What is SSRF?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Server-side request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>_What is the impact of SSRF attacks?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A successful SSRF attack can often result in unauthorized actions or access to data within the organization. This can be in the vulnerable application, or on other back-end systems that the application can communicate with. In some situations, the SSRF vulnerability might allow an attacker to perform arbitrary command execution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An SSRF exploit that causes connections to external third-party systems might result in malicious onward attacks. these can appear to originate from the organization hosting the vulnerable application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Common SSRF attacks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SSRF attacks often exploit trust relationships to escalate an attack from the vulnerable application and perform unauthorized actions. These trust relationships might exist in relation to the server, or in relation to other back-end systems within the same organization.     </li>
</ul>
