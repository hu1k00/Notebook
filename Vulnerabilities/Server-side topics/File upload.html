    <li><p><strong>What are file upload vulnerabilities?</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>File upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>What is the impact of file upload vulnerabilities?</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>The impact of file upload vulnerabilities generally depends on two key factors:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Which aspect of the file the website fails to validate properly, whether that be its size, type, contents, and so on.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>What restrictions are imposed on the file once it has been successfully uploaded.   </p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><code>In the worst case scenario, the file&#39;s type isn&#39;t validated properly, and the server configuration allows certain types of file (such as .php and .jsp) to be executed as code. In this case, an attacker could potentially upload a server-side code file that functions as a web shell, effectively granting them full control over the server.</code></p>
