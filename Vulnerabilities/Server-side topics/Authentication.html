<h1 id="authentication-vulnerabilities">Authentication vulnerabilities</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>What is authentication?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. Websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet. This makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are three main types of authentication:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Something you know, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called &quot;knowledge factors&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Something you have, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called &quot;possession factors&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Something you are or do. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called &quot;inherence factors&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What is the difference between authentication and authorization?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.        </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How do authentication vulnerabilities arise?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms occur in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes called &quot;broken authentication&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>OAuth 2.0 authentication vulnerabilities</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>While browsing the web, you&#39;ve almost certainly come across sites that let you log in using your social media account. The chances are that this feature is built using the popular OAuth 2.0 framework. OAuth 2.0 is highly interesting for attackers because it is both extremely common and inherently prone to implementation mistakes. This can result in a number of vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to obtain sensitive user data and potentially bypass authentication completely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What is OAuth?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OAuth is a commonly used authorization framework that enables websites and web applications to request limited access to a user&#39;s account on another application. Crucially, OAuth allows the user to grant this access without exposing their login credentials to the requesting application. This means users can fine-tune which data they want to share rather than having to hand over full control of their account to a third party. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>How does OAuth 2.0 work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>OAuth 2.0 was originally developed as a way of sharing access to specific data between applications. It works by defining a series of interactions between three distinct parties, namely a client application, a resource owner, and the OAuth service provider.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client application</strong> - The website or web application that wants to access the user&#39;s data.</li>
<li><strong>Resource owner</strong> - The user whose data the client application wants to access.</li>
<li><strong>OAuth service provider</strong> - The website or application that controls the user&#39;s data and access to it. They support OAuth by providing an API for interacting with both an authorization server and a resource server.             </li>
</ul>
